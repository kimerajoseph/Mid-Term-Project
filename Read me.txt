IRON HACK DATA ANALYTICS BOOT CAMP: MID-TERM PROJECT

ThE project attempts to prove the assumption that e-commerce websites' visitors who spend more than 20 minutes on the prodcuts
pages are more likely to buy those products than those who spend less time. The project uses data from an unnamed e-commerce
store. The project utilizes modern libraries and tools to clean, store, analyze and visualize the data

Programming Languanges
- Python
- MySQL

Libraries/Modules
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scipy
- pymysql

Visualization Tools
- Tableau

Importing dependencies
``` 
        import pandas as pd
        import Maplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
	import scipy.stats as st
        import pymysql
        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        import getpass 
```
The project uses Python because its one of the best languages in data analysis. It has a wide range of libraries and modules that are 
great for data analysis and visualization
Tableau is used to make presentations because of its beautful user interfaces and ease of interaction

CLASSSIFICATION
The project classsifies website visitors into Visitors and Cusomers
Visitors - People that visited the site but never bought any item
Customers - People/bots that visited the website and bought items

The project tracks visitors and customers' behaviour like time spent on various pages, the month they visited, browser and operarting system used to access the site. We use data analysis tools to check for patterns and corellations in the data
